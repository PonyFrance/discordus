# slackus

***

This simple application monitors a Disqus forum (website) and sends a
notification to a Slack channel when a new comment is made in said forum.
Can be easily deployed to Heroku.

To configure the application, either edit config.js or set the following
environment variables:

```
SLACKUS_DISQUS_API_KEY=[your api key]
SLACKUS_DISQUS_API_SECRET=[your api secret]
SLACKUS_DISQUS_ACCESS_TOKEN=[your access token]
SLACKUS_DISQUS_FORUM=[your forum's shortname]
SLACKUS_SLACK_WEBHOOK=[your incoming webhook's url]
```

It's possible to check for comments on multiple forums simultaneously. To do so,
enter their shortnames as a comma seperated list, for example `cats,stuff`.

Your Disqus API key, secret and access token can be found by creating an
application on https://disqus.com/api/applications/.

Your Disqus forum's shortname can be found on the settings page for your site
(https://disqus.com/admin/, select your site under Settings).

Finally, you can set up an Incoming WebHook for Slack on
https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook.

Optional environment variables:

```
SLACKUS_INTERVAL=60       # Seconds between each check (60 by default)
SLACKUS_DISQUS_LIMIT=25   # Number of comments to check (25 by default, max 100)
SLACKUS_SLACK_MENTION=joe # Users to mention when notification arrives
```

The server will every X seconds (`SLACKUS_INTERVAL`) request the X most recent
comments (`SLACKUS_DISQUS_LIMIT`) to check for new ones. If your forum may
receive more than 25 new comments in a 60 second window, tweak those two
variables to your liking.

Some more configuration options for Disqus and Slack are available in config.js.
